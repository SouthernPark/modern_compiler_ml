# modern_compiler_ml
exercise repo for the book "Modern Compiler Implementation in ML"

exercise.sml in each chapter is the answer for exercises in that chapter.

exercise_test.sml are test cases to test the functions I wrote.

test_frameword.sml contains a "general_test" function I wrote to test if a function passed the expected test cases.
